Why
---

This is a Javascript implementation for use in generative NFTs. This 
version is developed to work with 
[fx(params)](https://www.fxhash.xyz/doc/collect/fxparams-mint-tickets).  

To test the game with fx(lens) use `npm run start`. To build the project in 
the dist/ folder for use in a web server or in the blockhain, use 
`npm run build`.  

If you don't know what "npm" is, go to `https://nodejs.org/en`
